# 2Captcha Residential Proxy Setup Guide

## Step 1: Access Your 2Captcha Dashboard

1. Go to https://2captcha.com (or https://2captcha.com/enterpage)
2. Login with your account (email: blazefoley97@gmail.com)
3. Look for one of these menu items:
   - "Proxy" or "Proxies"
   - "Residential Proxies"
   - "Proxy Service"
   - "Services" → "Proxy"

## Step 2: Find Your Proxy Credentials

You're looking for connection details in one of these formats:

### Format 1: Standard Proxy
```
host: proxy.2captcha.com (or similar)
port: 8080 or 9000 or custom
username: your_username or customer-XXXXXX
password: your_password or API key
```

### Format 2: Full Connection String
```
username:password@proxy.2captcha.com:8080
```

### Format 3: With Protocol
```
http://username:password@proxy.2captcha.com:8080
```

## Step 3: Copy the EXACT credentials you see

Example of what you might see:
```
Host: us-proxy.2captcha.com
Port: 8080
Username: customer-27424983-zone-resi
Password: xhj8k2m9pq4s
```

Or possibly:
```
Session-based format:
customer-27424983-session-random123:API_KEY@proxy.2captcha.com:8080
```

## Step 4: Send Me the Details

Once you have the credentials, paste them here in ANY format you see them. 
I'll convert them to the correct format for the system.

## Common 2Captcha Proxy Dashboard Locations

- https://2captcha.com/proxy
- https://2captcha.com/enterpage → Services tab
- https://2captcha.com/setting/proxy
- Under your account settings/profile
- In the "Additional Services" section

## What to Look For

The dashboard usually shows:
- ✅ Service Status: Active/Enabled
- ✅ Available Bandwidth
- ✅ Connection Endpoint (hostname/IP)
- ✅ Port Number
- ✅ Authentication Details (username/password)
- ✅ Region/Location options (US, EU, etc.)

## Notes

- Your 2Captcha API Key: 8861c78a551888d0d10a7f0624cee04c
- Your 2Captcha User ID: 27424983
- Current Balance: $3.73
- Residential Proxy Service: ✅ ACTIVE (confirmed via API)

The credentials are NOT your API key directly - they're separate proxy authentication details.
