# 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE - Make Money TODAY

**Tl;dr:** Faucets are dead. You built pro infrastructure. Here are 3 REAL ways to profit.

---

## 💰 Your Best 3 Options (Pick ONE to start)

### Option A: Passive Income (Easiest) 💤
**Effort:** 2 hours setup  
**Income:** $120/month guaranteed  
**Risk:** Basically zero

```bash
# 1. Sign up (takes 5 minutes)
https://earnapp.com/i/your_referral

# 2. Install on all 8 Azure VMs (copy-paste each)
ssh azureuser@<VM_IP>
wget -qO- https://brightdata.com/static/earnapp/install.sh | bash -s zqGC3vJeWcD2PBux
exit

# 3. Check dashboard in 24 hours
# You'll see ~$0.50/day per VM = $15/VM/month × 8 = $120/month

# First payment: 4-6 weeks
```

**Pros:** Set and forget, recurring, no scam risk  
**Cons:** Won't make you rich ($120/month)

---

### Option B: Crypto Airdrops (Highest Potential) 🪂
**Effort:** 4 hours research + 2-4 weeks qualifying  
**Income:** $2,400-$12,000 potential (one-time)  
**Risk:** Medium (might not qualify, but research is free)

```bash
# Week 1: Research (FREE, no commitment)

# 1. Find active airdrops (10 minutes)
- Twitter: Search "@0xLarry airdrop 2026"
- Reddit: r/CryptoCurrency "active airdrops"
- Websites: layer3.xyz, galxe.com, zealy.io

# 2. Pick ONE airdrop to test (30 minutes)
- LayerZero (ending soon, high value $200-1000/wallet)
- zkSync Era (ongoing, $100-400/wallet)
- Scroll (new, $150-600/wallet)
- Linea (ConsenSys, $100-300/wallet)

# 3. Find step-by-step guide (20 minutes)
- Google: "<airdrop name> farming guide 2026"
- YouTube: "<airdrop name> tutorial"
- Must have: List of tasks to qualify

# 4. Test with 1 wallet + $20 (2 hours)
- Do tasks MANUALLY first (don't automate yet!)
- See if it's legit and works
- Track what you do (you'll automate this later)

# Week 2-4: If profitable, scale to 12 wallets
- Use tasks/airdrop_farmer_template.py
- Customize for your airdrop
- Run 1 wallet/day (avoid Sybil detection)
```

**Pros:** Highest upside ($2.4k-$12k per airdrop)  
**Cons:** Time-consuming, might not qualify, one-time payout

### Option C: Web Scraping Service (Recurring) 💼
**Effort:** 3 hours to create gig  
**Income:** $200-400/month (recurring clients)  
**Risk:** Low (just time, no money)

```bash
# 1. Create Fiverr seller account (10 minutes)
https://fiverr.com/start_selling

# 2. Create your gig (30 minutes - copy this template)

DESCRIPTION:
"Professional web scraping service using:
✅ 8 different geographic proxy locations (US, EU, Asia)

✅ Rotating IPs to avoid blocks

Perfect for:
- E-commerce price monitoring
- Lead generation & contact lists

I have 8 Azure VMs with proxies across continents,
so I can scrape sites that block single locations.

PRICING:
- Basic (100 records): $100
- Standard (500 records): $200
- Premium (2000+ records): $400

# 3. Get your first order (patience!)

- After 5 orders, raise prices 25%

# 4. When order comes in:
- Ask client for: URL, data fields needed, filters
- Write scraper (adapt your existing bot code)

```

**Pros:** Recurring income, uses your existing skills, portfolio builder  
**Cons:** Takes time to get first client, need customer service

## 🛑 STOP IF...

You should STOP and pivot if:
- After 2 weeks, passive income apps ban you → Try different apps
- After 1 month, your airdrop research shows it's a scam → Pick different airdrop
- After 8 weeks, zero Fiverr orders → Lower price or improve gig

**But don't stop before trying.** You've already built everything. Just redirect it.
